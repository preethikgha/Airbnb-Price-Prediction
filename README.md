# Airbnb Price Prediction 

This project is a **basic machine learning regression project** where we predict Airbnb listing prices using Linear Regression.
It includes **data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, model training, and evaluation.**

##  Dataset

* **Source:** Seattle Airbnb Open Data (from Kaggle)
* **File Used:** `listings.csv`

---

##  Project Workflow

1. Dataset Loading
2. Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling
3. Feature Engineering
4. Data Visualization:

   * Price Distribution
   * Correlation Heatmap
   * Actual vs Predicted Price Scatter Plot
5. Model Training using Linear Regression
6. Model Evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² Score

---

##  Results

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** \~35.57
* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** \~3267.77
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** \~57.16
* **R² Score:** \~0.60

###  Future Scope

* Apply advanced regression techniques like Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, or Gradient Boosting to improve accuracy.
* Implement cross-validation to improve model stability.
* Perform detailed model diagnostics using **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** for better statistical insights.
* Explore additional features like location-specific trends, seasonal demand, and property amenities.
